                The infected are humans who have been infected by the Cordyceps brain infection and subsequently mutated into horrific new forms. The resulting creatures are aggressive, and will attack any uninfected human and animals on sight.<br>
                For humans that have been exposed to a mutated strain of Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis, the fungus attacks the brain and begins to alter the behavior of its host. The host will then go through four different stages of infection: runner, stalker, clicker, and bloater or shambler; each stage is more dangerous than the last. However some have had resistance to the infection, notably Ellie; she hasn't turned despite being infected for over five years. There is also the unique rat king stage.

                <b>Trivia:</b><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the cartoon The Amazing World of Gumball, the episode "The Parasite" features a clicker when Gumball merges with Darwin in order to warn Anais. He also mentions that he takes the zombie's form from a video game.</li>
                    <li>Unlike with hostile humans, flashlights do not alert the infected to Joel's or Ellie's presence, although when shining the light in their eyes, they do appear to react to it by holding up their hands to shield said eyes. This could be due to their low intelligence, as it seemingly suggests that the infected are too simple-minded to distinguish flashlights from any other ambient light sources they encounter.</li>
