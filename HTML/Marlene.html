                Marlene was the final antagonist in The Last of Us. She was the commander of the Fireflies and a good friend of Ellie's mother Anna.
                As a Firefly, Marlene fought against the totalitarian rule of the military within the quarantine zones to restore a form of functional government. 
                The Fireflies have been successful in overthrowing military rule in several zones, namely Salt Lake City but their efforts have not always 
                achieved the desired results, as in Pittsburgh. Despite her and her organization's attempts to restore order, their numbers dwindled as the 
                military cracked down and killed members found within the zones.

                <b>Trivia:</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Marlene carries the same kind of 9mm pistol as Ellie.</li>
                    <li>  Her outfit during the finale of the game bears resemblance to Elena Fisher's outfit from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, a game also made by Naughty Dog.</li>
                    <li>Creative director Neil Druckmann remarked in the in-game commentary of the game's cutscenes he unintentionally had Marlene mirror David's belief: "everything happens for a reason"; which Marlene indirectly reiterates to Joel:
                         "maybe it was meant to be". He remarked it likely happened due to him "thinking about it, so naturally the characters 
                         end up talking about it as you're writing."</li>
                     <li>Originally, Marlene died in the surgery room during a cinematic, but Naughty Dog nixed the idea and removed the cutscene.</li>
                    <li>When the player first encounters Marlene, she has a stomach wound from a gunshot. When the player last encounters Marlene, 
after Joel rescues Ellie from surgery, he shoots Marlene in the stomach.</li>
