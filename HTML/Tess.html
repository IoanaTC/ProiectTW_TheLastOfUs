                Tess was a supporting character in The Last of Us. A hardened survivor, she was the long-term smuggling partner of Joel Miller. 
                The pair made their living as smugglers in Boston, where they traded with survivors outside of the city. She had a "dog-eat-dog" philosophy, similar to Joel and Ellie.<br>
                Tess was a leader; she led Joel effortlessly and made friends with many of the people that she met. 
                She had a wide range of contacts and was universally respected, and often feared, among the residents of the Boston Zone. 
                Tess, like most survivors, was ruthless, and did not flinch at the thought of killing people, but conversely was kind to Ellie, 
                more so than Joel originally, and did her best to reassure and protect her. Tess also seemed to lack patience; she decided to shoot 
                the man hired by Robert instead of talking to him.

                <b>Skills and abilities</b><br><br>
                Tess was a natural leader, being the brains behind Joel's muscle in their partnership. She was also well connected, being respected, and even feared, by many people within the Boston QZ.
                Like most hardened survivors, she was skilled in combat, having killed many infected over the years. 
                She was able to kill runners and clickers with just a 9mm pistol and her fists, and even two armored soldiers in the same manner.
                 She was skilled enough in hand-to-hand combat to be able to kill two men by herself, despite being injured and taken by surprise.
                  She was also quite stealthy, killing a man with a shiv by sneaking up on him.
                   She wasn't invincible, though; a runner successfully bit her, resulting in her contracting the infection and was later killed by a 
                   squad of soldiers, despite managing to kill two of them.
