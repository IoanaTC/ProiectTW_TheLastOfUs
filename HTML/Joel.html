                Joel was a survivor in post-apocalyptic America that had been ravaged by the Cordyceps brain infection.
                 After losing his only daughter Sarah in the early stages of the outbreak, Joel became a ruthless and cynical smuggler eventually tasked with 
                 smuggling and protecting Ellie Williams, a young girl who was the key to mankind's survival. Joel eventually formed a strong bond with her.<br>
                 A brutal survivor with few moral lines left to cross. Joel, now in his late 40s, has been hardened by the ravages of the fungal pandemic that has devastated civilization as we know it.
                  He's lost friends, family, and everything he valued in life. Living in one of few remaining military-controlled quarantine zones, 
                  he operates as a black market smuggler, dealing in contraband, taking numerous de-humanizing jobs over the years to survive in this new 
                  post-pandemic world. Joel's conscience slowly dwindles away as he shuts down his emotions to cope to his new life.
                <br>During the aftermath of the epidemic that struck the country, Joel had initially become a hunter, stealing from and 
                killing innocent people in order to get by. His time as a hunter darkened him, the man torturing individuals in a way that 
                gave his brother "nightmares." This continued for several years, before he resorted to working in black-market dealings 
                and smuggling items or people of interest through quarantine zones or other designated areas. Because of this, he accumulated 
                valuable knowledge in regards to surviving the post-apocalyptic environment. Joel rarely showed signs of happiness and was often 
                cynical. Ellie notes that Joel had stained his hands with innocent blood when he revealed to her that he had been "on both 
                sides", thus having the knowledge about a hunters' ambush and anticipating it. This dark past contributed to his experience as a 
                hardened survivalist.

                <b>Skills and abilities</b><br><br>
                As a hardened survivalist, Joel displayed terrifying intensity, strength, cunning, and fierce fist-fighting prowess; 
                he could perform fatal chokeholds, string combinations of hard punches, and other miscellaneous attacks with little 
                fatigue or hesitance, and became adept to the point where he can out-brawl and overwhelm opponents half his age quite quickly.
