                Ellie Williams is the central character of "The Last of Us" series.<br>
                A brave, 14-year-old girl, Ellie has grown up in this harsh world and it is all she has ever known.
                She's an orphan who was raised in a boarding school run by the military within the bounds of the quarantine zone. 
                Na√Øve and curious about the outside world, she is wise beyond her years and highly capable of taking care of herself and those around her. 
                Obsessed with comic books, CDs, and other pop culture,
                her knowledge base is filled by the remnants of a world that no longer exists.
                <br>Ellie Williams was born in the spring of 2019, by which time the Cordyceps brain infection had spread throughout the United States.
                As a child, Ellie grew up as an orphan in an oppressive military quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts, with little knowledge of the world before infection.
                Having been raised in an environment where modern standards and values have deteriorated, Ellie is considerably rash, foul-mouthed, impulsive, and temperamental, 
                and is unfazed by the notion of using violence as a means to an end or profanity as a way of expressing how she feels. However, she manages to maintain a particular
                innocence as she has yet to see the darkest sides of human nature, and retains a palpable trust in people. 
                This serves as the juxtaposition to Joel's wary, morose, and cynical outlook on post-pandemic life. 
                Ellie is also perceptibly clever and witty, and will do whatever it takes to keep Joel and herself alive. She has good survival instinct and she can be resourceful. 
                She takes orders from Joel, but all the while makes it clear she does not "need any babysitting at all".
                <br><br>
                <b>Skills and abilities</b><br><br>
                Initially, Ellie is fairly unskilled in survival techniques. She cannot swim, a hindrance to herself since swimming is crucial, given the amount of water bodies in the locations she travels. 
                She carries a switchblade, which is her only weapon until she is trusted with a gun by Joel.Her youth leads Joel to initially doubt her competence so he does not grant a firearm to Ellie until she saves him by shooting a hunter,
                and only afterwards does he teach her how to use a hunting rifle. Later on, she becomes more proficient in combat, sporting a number of weapons such as a pistol, rifle, bow, and explosives, along with her trademark switchblade.
                She can also ride a horse.
