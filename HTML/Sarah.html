                <b>Trivia:</b><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sarah is the first playable character in the game, but her interaction is limited only to moving and looking around. However, she can still interact with five items in her household.</li>
                    <li>In Sarah's room is a birthday card that she forgot to give to Joel and it states that even though they are almost complete opposites in what they like, Joel remains "The best dad in the world" to her.</li>
                    <li>Sarah appears to be a fan of a rock band called "The Bash", due to a poster on her bedroom wall.</li>
                    <li>Sarah is a fan of the "Dawn of the Wolf" films, a play on the Twilight saga, as seen by a poster in her bedroom. When pressed by Ellie, Joel implies that Sarah dragged him to see it, although he says that he doesn't remember that particular event.</li>
